<!-- Whatever you write below will show up as the speaker's bio -->

(Todo: ask for bio) I am an assistant professor in computer science department at Columbia University, where I direct the Columbia Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (CAIR) Lab . My research focuses on computer vision and robotics. Iâ€™m interested in developing algorithms that enable intelligent systems to learn from their interactions with the physical world, and autonomously acquire the perception and manipulation skills necessary to execute complex tasks and assist people.
