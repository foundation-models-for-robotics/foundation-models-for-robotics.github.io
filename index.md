The rise of large foundation models, large language models (LLMs) and visual language models (VLMs), has opened a new era for robotics. These models, with their in-context learning and prompting capabilities, enable humans to interactively create new workflows, authorize new tasks, and construct high-level motion plans to solve tasks through a natural language interface. Compared with traditional robotics where task specification has to be done through a rule-based system that gets broken with environmental changes, LLM-equipped robots demonstrate the capability to solve real world problems in diverse environments on demand. Furthermore, researchers have recently begun to explore the use of foundation models in other robotic applications, such as action generation and understanding of physics and dynamics, which generalizes to unseen settings. These discoveries naturally lead us to the next big question: How far are we away from a true “robotic GPT” moment where robots become ready for everyone and integrated into everyday life?

In this workshop, we plan to:
- Foster collaborations between a diverse group of researchers and practitioners from a diverse background, from both industry and academia, within and outside the robotics field, who work on problems ranging from task and motion planning, vision and understanding, to motion control.
- Discuss the current progresses, challenges and limitations in applying foundation models to robotic problems at all levels: from decision making and motion planning to motor control. 
- Explore the future of “robotic foundation models”: What it would be like, and how we can arrive there. We aim to review various methods tuning existing VLM/LLMs for robotic usage, from prompting to finetuning, and discuss how to connect the missing embodiment concept and physical understanding with existing model training techniques.


### Tentative Schedule

The workshop will happen on November 6th, 2023 for both in-person and online attendees. The in-person location is in Atlanta, USA.
