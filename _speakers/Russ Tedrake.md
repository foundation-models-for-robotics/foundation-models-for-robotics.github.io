<!-- Whatever you write below will show up as the speaker's bio -->

Russ Tedrake is the Toyota Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Aeronautics and Astronautics, and Mechanical Engineering at MIT. He is interested in finding elegant control solutions for interesting (underactuated, stochastic, and/or difficult to model) dynamical systems that he can build and experiment with. He is particularly interested in finding connections between mechanics (especially non-smooth mechanics) and optimization theory which enable formal analysis and control design for complex mechanical systems. These days He is primarily interested in bringing the rigor of systems theory to robot manipulation.
