<!-- Whatever you write below will show up as the speaker's bio -->

Marc Toussaint is a professor in the area of AI & Robotics at TU Berlin. His research interests are in the intersection of AI and robotics, namely in using Machine Learning, optimization, and AI reasoning to tackle fundamental problems in robotics. He work on models and algorithms for physical reasoning, task-and-motion planning (logic-geometric programming), learning heuristics, the planning-as-inference paradigm, algorithms and methods for robotic building construction, and learning to transfer model-based strategies to reactive and adaptive real-world behavior.
