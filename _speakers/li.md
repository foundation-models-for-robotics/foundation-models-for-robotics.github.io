<!-- Whatever you write below will show up as the speaker's bio -->

(Todo: ask for bio) I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student at Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) at MIT, advised by Prof. Antonio Torralba. I also work closely with Igor Mordatch. My research interests lie in Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, Decision Making, and Machine Learning. In particular, I am interested in developing AI systems that exhibit generalization abilities to solve a wide range of tasks outside the training distribution.
